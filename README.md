# Implementation of Univariate Linear Regression
## AIM:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
2. Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
3. Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula.

4. Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:

5. Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line.
6. Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# assign values in array

X = np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
Y = np.array([1,3,2,5,7,8,8,9,10,12])

# to find the mean values of X and Y

X_mean = np.mean(X)
print("Mean of X =",X_mean)
Y_mean = np.mean(Y)
print("Mean of Y =",Y_mean)

# To Find The Summation

num = 0
denum = 0
for i in range(len(X)):
  num+=(X[i]-X_mean)*(Y[i]-Y_mean)
  denum+=(X[i]-X_mean)**2

# To find the slope for least square method

m=num/denum

  # To find the Y intercept 

b=Y_mean-m*(X_mean)
print("m =",m)
print("b =",b)

#equation of the line 
Y_pred = m*X+b
print(Y_pred)

#plot graph
plt.scatter(X,Y,color='green')
plt.plot(X,Y_pred,color='red')
plt.show()

```
